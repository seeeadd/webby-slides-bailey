Bailey Vann Webinar Slides — Claude Code Redesign Brief
READ THIS FIRST
You are redesigning a PowerPoint presentation for Bailey Vann's free webinar. This is not a quick template job — this is a complete creative rebuild that should look like a $50K design agency created it.
Your mission: Make attendees think "Holy shit, I'm getting THIS for free? What happens when I actually pay her?"
________________


PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND BEFORE YOU TOUCH ANYTHING
Before writing a single line of code, analyze and internalize:
Who is Bailey Vann?
* Stay-at-home mom turned 7-figure Etsy seller
* Top 0.1% seller — elite, not beginner-level guru
* Warm, approachable, but undeniably expert
* Her brand = "your successful friend who actually knows what she's doing"
* NOT a cash-grab influencer. NOT desperate for approval. She has her own lane.
The psychological goal of these slides:
1. Keep them watching — every slide is a pattern interrupt, never boring
2. Build trust — "she's giving away secrets most people charge for"
3. Create desire — "if this is free, imagine what I get when I pay"
4. Micro-yeses — subliminal visual cues that make them nod along
5. Premium positioning — this looks like a $2,000 course, not a free webinar
The audience:
* Busy moms, side-hustlers, 9-5 escapees
* Overwhelmed by conflicting advice
* Skeptical of "guru" promises
* Want proof, not hype
* Need to feel understood, not sold to

}
Typography
Headers: OGG (Bold or Black weight) — elegant, distinctive serif Body: Satoshi Variable (Medium weight) — clean, modern sans-serif
If OGG/Satoshi unavailable, fallback to:
* Headers: Georgia Bold (serif with personality)
* Body: Arial or Helvetica (clean, professional)
Type Scale:
Hero titles:     48-60px  (OGG Bold/Black)
Section headers: 32-40px  (OGG Bold)
Subheadings:     20-24px  (Satoshi Medium)
Body text:       14-16px  (Satoshi Medium)
Captions:        11-12px  (Satoshi Medium, muted)
Visual Language
DO:
* Soft, organic shadows (not harsh drop shadows)
* Rounded corners (8-16px radius)
* Hand-drawn style annotations (arrows, circles, underlines)
* Floating decorative elements (stars, sparkles, dollar signs — but subtle)
* Sticky note / Post-it aesthetic for callouts
* Gradient backgrounds (soft cream → blush transitions)
* Layered depth (cards floating on backgrounds)
* "Magazine editorial" layouts — asymmetric, intentional white space
DON'T:
* Emojis (they cheapen everything)
* Generic icons from icon libraries
* Canva template aesthetics
* Harsh gradients or neon colors
* Centered-everything boring layouts
* Stock photo vibes
* AI-generated generic graphics

PHASE 3: CUSTOM GRAPHICS PHILOSOPHY
Every visual should be CUSTOM and CONTEXTUAL. Not decorative filler.
Approach for each slide:
1. Read the text — what is the core message?
2. Visualize the concept — how can this be shown, not just said?
3. Design a custom graphic that:
   * Reinforces the message
   * Adds clarity (not confusion)
   * Feels hand-crafted (not template)
   * Could only exist for THIS slide
Examples of custom graphics to build:
Slide Content
	Custom Graphic Idea
	"Your shop is like a garden"
	Illustrated garden with wilting vs thriving plants, shop icons as flowers
	"$0 → $3K journey"
	Visual timeline with milestone markers, growth curve
	"Delete 200+ products"
	Before/after Etsy shop dashboard mockup showing cluttered vs clean
	"3-hour weekly routine"
	Custom weekly calendar with time blocks illustrated
	"Algorithm loves fresh listings"
	Personified algorithm character giving hearts to new products
	Revenue milestones
	Custom revenue dashboard mockup with Bailey's actual numbers
	"Most people quit here"
	Mountain/journey illustration with X marks where people give up
	Building graphics:
Use SVG or HTML/CSS to create:
* Fake UI mockups (Etsy dashboards, notification screens)
* Custom illustrations (simple, flat-style, brand colors)
* Data visualizations (charts, graphs, progress bars)
* Journey maps and timelines
* Comparison graphics (before/after, this vs that)

PHASE 4: SLIDE-BY-SLIDE DESIGN RULES
Title/Section Slides
* BIG, bold headline (48-60px)
* Minimal supporting text
* Full creative visual treatment
* These are your "pattern interrupt" moments
* Consider full-bleed color backgrounds
Content Slides
* Clear visual hierarchy: headline → supporting points → visual
* Text should be scannable in 3 seconds
* One main idea per slide
* Custom graphic that ADDS to understanding
* Generous white space — don't cram
Story/Testimony Slides
* More editorial feel
* Pull quotes in large, elegant type
* Photo areas with soft frames/masks
* Personal, authentic vibe
Data/Proof Slides
* Numbers should be HUGE and prominent
* Context in smaller supporting text
* Custom charts/graphs (not Excel defaults)
* Before/after comparisons with clear visual distinction
Transition Slides
* Keep them moving forward
* Visual breadcrumbs (progress indicators)
* Mini pattern interrupts between sections
ANIMATION / REVEAL EFFECT THROUGH SLIDE DUPLICATION
PowerPoint animations can't be coded directly, so we fake it by duplicating slides.
When to use this:
When Bailey needs to explain something BEFORE the full content appears — so the audience isn't reading ahead while she's still talking.
How it works:
Instead of one slide with all the content, create 2-3 versions of the same slide:
Example — a slide with 3 bullet points:

Slide 14a: Just the headline, no bullets (Bailey introduces the topic)
Slide 14b: Headline + bullet 1 (Bailey explains first point)
Slide 14c: Headline + bullets 1 & 2 (Bailey explains second point)
Slide 14d: Headline + all 3 bullets (complete slide)

Example — a before/after reveal:

Slide 22a: Only the "BEFORE" graphic visible
Slide 22b: Both "BEFORE" and "AFTER" visible (transformation revealed)

Example — a big number reveal:

Slide 79a: Setup text: "After switching to digital products..."
Slide 79b: The big "$1,000,000+" appears

When to apply this:

Stats/data reveals (build anticipation)
Framework explanations (one piece at a time)
Story beats (reveal the twist)
Any moment Bailey says "and here's the thing..." before revealing

Keep the layout identical between duplicates — only the content visibility changes. This creates a seamless "animation" effect when clicking through.

PHASE 5: MICRO-COMMITMENT PSYCHOLOGY
Build in subliminal "yes" triggers throughout:
Visual micro-yeses:
* Checkmarks appearing next to achieved milestones
* Progress bars filling up
* "You're here" markers on journey maps
* Nodding head iconography (subtle)
* Green checkmarks vs red X's in comparisons
* "Unlocked" visual states
Layout psychology:
* Left-to-right flow = progress
* Upward angles = growth
* Warm colors on positive outcomes
* Cool/muted on "before" states
* Highlighted/glowing areas draw focus to key points
Framing psychology:
* Loss aversion: show what they're MISSING by not continuing
* Social proof: "others are already doing this" visuals
* Authority: Bailey's credentials displayed elegantly
* Scarcity: "this is rare" visual treatment for key insights
________________


PHASE 6: LAYOUT CREATIVITY
Break the template mold. Be unexpected.
Layout patterns to use:
1. Magazine Editorial — asymmetric columns, text wrapping around visuals
2. Full-Bleed Moments — slide completely filled with visual, text overlay
3. Split Contrast — left side "before/problem", right side "after/solution"
4. Floating Cards — content in elevated cards over gradient backgrounds
5. Diagonal Cuts — angled section dividers (not harsh, subtle 5-10°)
6. Sticky Note Overlay — handwritten-style notes "pinned" to slides
7. Dashboard Mockup — entire slide designed like a UI screenshot
8. Journey Timeline — horizontal or vertical story progression
Spacing rules:
* 20-40px slide margins (breathing room)
* 12-16px gaps between cards/elements
* 8-12px internal padding on containers
* Generous line-height (1.5-1.6) for readability

PHASE 7: WHAT MAKES THIS "WORTH PAYING FOR"
The slides should communicate:
Expertise signals:
* Specific numbers (not vague claims)
* Behind-the-scenes data visualizations
* "Secret" information styling (unlocked padlocks, revealed content)
* Professional-grade polish in every detail
Quality signals:
* No typos, perfect alignment, consistent spacing
* Intentional color choices (not random)
* Custom graphics that took obvious effort
* Typography that shows design knowledge
Value signals:
* "Most courses don't show you this" visual treatment
* Content density that respects their time
* Clear takeaways on every slide
* "Write this down" moments called out

PHASE 8: EXECUTION APPROACH FOR CLAUDE CODE
Step 1: Extract and analyze the current deck
Read the uploaded PPTX → Extract all text content → List every slide's purpose
Step 2: Plan the visual approach
For each slide, determine:
- What's the one main message?
- What custom graphic would enhance it?
- What layout pattern fits?
- Where are the emphasis moments?
Step 3: Set up the design system
Create shared.css with:
- All CSS variables (colors, fonts)
- Reusable component styles
- Animation/transition presets
Step 4: Build slides in HTML
Each slide is 960x540px HTML file
Use the html2pptx workflow
Build custom SVG graphics inline
Layer elements for depth
Step 5: Visual QA
Convert to images → Review each slide → Check:
- Is hierarchy clear?
- Does the graphic add value?
- Would this make someone say "damn"?
- Is spacing/alignment perfect?
Step 6: Iterate ruthlessly
If a slide feels "fine" — it's not good enough
Push until every slide is a portfolio piece

________________
FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE DELIVERY
Every slide must pass these tests:
* [ ] Could this only exist for Bailey's brand? (Not generic)
* [ ] Does the graphic ADD understanding? (Not just decoration)
* [ ] Is there clear visual hierarchy? (Know where to look first)
* [ ] Would this make someone screenshot it? (That good)
* [ ] Is spacing/alignment pixel-perfect?
* [ ] Does it support the psychological goal?
* [ ] Zero cheap/template/Canva vibes?
* [ ] Does it feel expensive but NOT corporate?

THE NORTH STAR
When in doubt, ask: "Would someone pay $2,000 for a course that uses slides like this?"
If yes → ship it. If no → redesign it.
This is not about making slides. This is about making Bailey look like the undeniable expert she is — through design that matches her value.
Go make something incredible.
